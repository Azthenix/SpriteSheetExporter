    <div>
      <p>SpriteSheet Exporter is a plugin that will generate a spritesheet arranged from bottom to top placement of layers and grouped by rows.</p>
      <p>Let's try to look at this example document structure:</p>
<pre>
<code>Document
+ Row 4 Column 1 (Paint layer)
+ Row 3 Column 1 (Paint layer)
+ Row 2 Column 1 (Paint layer)
+ Row 1 Column 1 (Paint layer)
</code></pre>
      <p>These layers are named according to placement. A single paint layer in the top level will be considered a single row and placed in column 1. As such they will all take up a row on their own.</p>
      <p>Note: The layers are named for demonstration purposes, they can have any name.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Now let's look at this second example:</p>
<pre><code>Document
v Row 3 (Group layer)
  + Column 2 (Paint layer)
  + Column 1 (Paint layer)
v Row 2 (Group layer)
  + Column 3 (Paint layer)
  + Column 2 (Paint layer)
  + Column 1 (Paint layer)
+ Row 1 Column 1 (Paint layer)
</code></pre>
      <p>These layers are also named according to placement. Layers inside a group layer will be arranged horizontally from left to right starting from the bottom layer.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Now let's look at this final example:</p>
<pre><code>Document
v Row 1 (Group layer)
  v Column 2 (Group layer)
    + Head (Paint layer)
    + Body (Paint layer)
    + Arms (Paint layer)
    + Legs (Paint layer)
  > Column 1 (Group layer)
</code></pre>
      <p>Group layers inside a top-level group layer will be flattened, and the flattened version of the second-level group layer will be the output of that column.</p>
